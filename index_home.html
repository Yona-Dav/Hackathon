       <article>
        <p>Hangman is a simple word guessing game</p>
        <p><span>The Goal:  </span>Guess the word before your man gets hung!</p>
        <p><span>How to play?  </span> The computer thinks of a word and the player tries to guess what is one letter at a time. The computer draws a number of dash equivalent to the number of letters in the word. If a player press or enter a letters that occurs in the word, the computer fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places.
        If the word does not contain the entered/pressed letter, the computer draws one element of a hangman's gallows and the letter "desapears". As the game progresses, a segment of the gallows and of a victim is added for every pressed/entered letter not in the word.</p>
        <p><span>The levels:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy : The words are simple and the number of incorrect guesses before the game ends is 10.</li>
            <li>Medium : The words are difficult to guess and the number of incorrect guesses before the game ends is 6.</li>
            <li>Hard : The words are difficult to guess, the number of incorrect guesses before the game ends is 6 and you have 1:30 to guess the word. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
